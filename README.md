# Scoring: Default Risk Prediction 

## Objective of the project: 
The measurement of risk consists in measuring the probability of default of a borrower. In this project, we propose several models to explain the variable “BAD” (taking modality 1 if the borrower is in default and 0 otherwise) by other input variables.
